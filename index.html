          <p>Let's use Watson's Dialog API to gather the facts of the case. We'll apply these facts to Watson's Concept Insights API to find connections. All of the objects and clues can be stored together in Hackpad.</p>
          
          <h5>// An Example</h5>
          <p>Usage of the Concept Insights API has already been proven with some manual queries. Objects such as a <strong>coin, key, letter, ring, pocket watch, and towel</strong> can be related to single concepts in Wikipedia. Actually, many of these objects can have multiple meanings, but we'll stay with the physical objects in this example.</p>
          <p>What concept connects all of these objects?
            <strong>A Chain</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Coins are often an ornament on a necklace (chain).</li>
                <li>Keys are carried on a keychain.</li>
                <li>Letters can be chain letters.</li>
                <li>Rings are links of a chain.</li>
                <li>Pocket watches are attached to a chain.</li>
                <li>Towels are chains of thread.</li>
          </ul>
          
          I'll admit that isn't very useful as a clue, but imagine if some of these objects were people and places. Luckily, there is tons of Sherlock Homes data in Wikipedia!</p>
        
        <h5>// TODO</h5>
        <p>Using the Dialog API to gather facts is our first priority. There's already a pizza ordering demo for us to reference. <strong>It's elementary!</strong></p>
